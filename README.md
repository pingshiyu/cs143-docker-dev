# cool-docker
Docker Development Environment for the Cool language - so that it can be used just like a VM.

Unfortunately it did not seem to work with Docker Development Environment, as of 05/Nov/2022. 

Seems that the base image, `i386/ubuntu`, is incompatible with Visual Studio Code. On the other hand, the image `amd64/ubuntu` works with Visual Studio Code, but not with the compiler used in the course.
